# Task 06 – Deep Fake Interview

## 📌 Overview
This task is an **extension of Task 5 (Descriptive Statistics & LLMs)**.  
The objective was to take the narrative derived from the NBA 2023–24 dataset and transform it into an **AI-generated “deep fake” style interview**.  

Since many free tools restrict full video generation, I produced an **audio-only interview** using **Descript**, with two distinct AI voices (Interviewer & Respondent).

## 🎬 Process
1. **Narrative Source:** Based on Task 5 findings (NBA 2023–24 season). Luka Dončić was identified as the standout all-around player.  
2. **Script Creation:** Wrote a short street-style Q&A with 6–8 questions.  
3. **Tools Attempted:**
   - Synthesia → Attempted, but video was rejected.  
   - HeyGen → Limited by free credits.  
   - D-ID → Created animated avatars, but not the desired “street” format.  
   - **Descript → Final tool used. Successfully generated an audio interview.**  
4. **Final Output:** Audio-only interview (~2 minutes) featuring conversational Q&A.

## 🔍 Findings
- Free tools impose significant limitations (watermarks, credit caps, rejected videos).  
- Audio interviews are a practical alternative and still achieve the task’s narrative goal.  
- Descript allowed multi-voice conversations, simulating interviewer and respondent.  

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Experiment with hybrid formats (real interviewer voice + AI respondent).  
- Combine audio with stock/street-style video using free editors like CapCut.  
- Explore student credits for tools like HeyGen or Synthesia.
